## Part 7: using your language

Congratulations! You have now made your own programming language. It's time to take it out for a spin.

Any programming language with respect for itself needs to have a standard library. This is a collection of useful functions provided with the language, distributed with the language.

In this section we will create various useful functions, all implemented purely in the Lisp. No Julia this time!

For this part, you should consider the provided tests more like suggestions than something you *have* to follow. It is your language, after all, and you decide what should be in its library.

```bash
julia tests/test_7_using_the_language.jl
```
