;; Some example lisp code. By the end of the tutorial, our Lisp will be
;; able to run this.

;; To run the code:
;;
;;    ./diy example.diy
;;

(define fact 
    ;; Factorial function
    (lambda (n) 
        (if (eq n 0) 
            1 ; Factorial of 0 is 1
            (* n (fact (- n 1))))))

;; When parsing the file, the last statement is returned
(fact 5)
